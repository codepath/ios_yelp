-------------------------
Search results page 
----------------------
* Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
* Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

Filter page
----------------------
* The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
* The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states
* Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
* Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
* Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
